You must identify a classification task from the dataset that contains three or more classes to predict. That is it cannot be a binary classification; it must be multi-class prediction. "

    "[15 points] Choose and explain what metric(s) you will use to evaluate your algorithmâ€™s performance. You should give a detailed argument for why this (these) metric(s) are appropriate on your data. That is, why is the metric appropriate for the task (e.g., in terms of the business case for the task). Please note: rarely is accuracy the best evaluation metric to use. Think deeply about an appropriate measure of performance.\n",

Convince me that your cross validation method is a realistic mirroring of how an algorithm would be used in practice. \n",
